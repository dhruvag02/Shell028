Name of resultant file is File3. 


Hello, This is File1. 
This file has been created to demonstrate use of filter commnads like HEAD command and TAIL command. 
The file should atleast contain 6-7 lines as first 5lines have to b.
I have assigned this work on 26-11-2020 on thursday Lab hours and have to complete it. 
I have to mke one more file with atleast 16-17 lines because I have to concatenante line 6 to line 15 in that file.
and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. 
Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.
File does not have 15 lines so Iam adding mmore lines so that file can have more than 15 lines. 
I have to perform operations from line 6 to line 15 so I need atleast 15 lines to do my work.
Forests at different latitudes and elevations, 
and with different precipitation and evapotranspiration form distinctly different biomes: boreal forests around the poles, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. 
Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.
